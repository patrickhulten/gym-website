        <h2>Eat Animals: Get Big!</h2>
          <p>You need to eat meat to be a good athlete, just ask Dr. Joe Rogan. I eat as much meat and fat as possible every day. I stay in ketosis all year round. What is ketosis you ask? Honeslty I'm no dietician but if the keto diet justifies gorging my face with bacon and butter all the time and eating as little fruits and vegetables as possible sign me up. I do miss the slamming cases of bud light on the fourth but damn it the gains are worth it. You know what is keto friendly? good ol' whiskey. My favorite post workout meal is a steak slathered in coconut oil with a big glass of bourbon and a cigar. Aint nothin wrong with smoking cigars post training, We don't do cardio here at Jimbo's, cardio kills your gains and I got me a one way ticket on the gain train. Straight to Gainsville. First class. Shoot I'd smoke a cigar in the squat rack if the kid at the front desk would stop yelling at me.</p>
          <p>Anyway my point is eat your five servings of meats a day and get your macros filled. Cheat day means a cup of bacon grease and a massage at madame Kamay's palace while Joe Rogan plays in the background. My top five favotie meals:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Elk meat and onion sautee</li>
            <li>Pork rib and sausage</li>
            <li>Steak, coconut oil and whiskey</li>
            <li>Bacon, eggs and butter coffee</li>
            <li>Chicken cooked extra rare</li>
          </ol>
